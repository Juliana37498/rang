## Roadmap

Features we'd like to add.

* Now
  * ~~Starts out with a picture, don't need to click Start New Game OR starts out with controls and then hides them until the game is complete.~~
  * Automatically checks the resources folder, unzips each foo.zip into www/images/foo and adds it to the theme list.
  * ~~Better layout-- centered, no sidebar.~~
  * ~~Debug setting-- if a file named .debug exists, then show the word and the debug button, otherwise don't.~~
* Now if easy
  * ~~Show the alphabet, cross out the wrong letters, highlight the right ones green.~~
  * ~~Use either enter or click submit for updates~~
  * ~~Automatically delete extra letters~~ 
* Later
  * ~~Renames the options in Select Wordlist so that the _wordlist.txt suffix is not shown.~~
  * Slider for difficulty-- the higher the difficulty the fewer the images
  * Sorts the contents of each www/images/foo according to natural order (i.e. no padding required) and takes an evenly spaced number of images set by the difficulty slider
  * Multi-file architecture
